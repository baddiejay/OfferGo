# OfferGo!
OfferGo! is a project I did together with my partner Alessandro Costantino for the database course at Federico II university, year 2018/2019.

The goal is to create a platform that would allow users to view the offers uploaded by stores on the platform according to product category or geographic area and leave reviews about the stores and promotions.
